        <p>This is a trip that I feel everyone should make in the next 20 years.</p>
        <p>...That was ominous.</p>
        <p>I'll explain everything about why, but first, I am going to recount my trip to Banff, Jasper and Vancouver in
            Canada!</p>

        <h3>Banff</h3>
        <p>Banff is a beautiful town located in the heart of the Canadian Rockies. It's known for its stunning mountain
            scenery, outdoor activities, and vibrant culture. The main attractions there are Banff National Park, Lake
            Louise, Moraine Lake (the picture above is one that I took of Moraine Lake), and the Banff Gondola. The main
            reason people visit Banff is for the glacial lakes, Lake Louise, Moraine Lake, Peyto Lake, Bow Lake, etc.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <h4>June 26</h4>
        <p>When we visited Banff, we stayed at Hidden Ridge Resort. The views of the Canadian Rockies from the resort
            were honestly amazing — we could see the mountains from multiple spots!</p>
        <p>We went to Bow Lake, but we couldn’t make it to Bow Falls because it started raining. From Bow Lake, you can
            still see the Banff Springs Hotel in the distance.</p>
        <p>That evening, we walked around downtown Banff and explored the shops and streets.</p>
        <p>For food that day, we tried Merhaba, an Indian restaurant, and Anejo, a Mexican spot. Both were really good!
        </p>

        <h4>June 27</h4>
        <p>This was the day we went on the Banff Gondola. Riding up the mountain was so cool because all around us were
            these huge mountain ranges and lakes. The only downside was that it was a little cloudy and rainy, but it
            was still really fun.</p>
        <p>At the top, there’s a coffee and souvenir shop. I’d totally recommend trying the London Fog — it’s a
            specialty drink in Canada and really tasty.</p>
        <p>Later, we checked out Two Jack Lake. The water there was super clear and blue, like nothing I’ve seen in the
            U.S.</p>
        <p>Lunch was at UNA, an Italian restaurant. Their pizza was delicious — definitely worth trying!</p>
        <p>One place I’d go back to for sure is Earl’s. The vibe there is lively, and they have food from lots of
            different cuisines.</p>

        <h4>June 28</h4>
        <p>Peyto Lake was incredible — the blue water and reflections made it super picture-worthy.</p>
        <p>Then we visited Moraine Lake, which is really famous too. The water here was more turquoise than blue. We did
            the Rockpile and Lakeshore hikes, which are short but give amazing views. Heads up: there’s no parking at
            Moraine Lake, so you need to take a bus from the visitor center or book online.</p>
        <p>Next, we went to Lake Louise. The best times to see it are sunrise or sunset because the lake between the
            mountains makes for perfect photos. Parking can be tricky, especially during busy times, so plan ahead. The
            water is crystal clear and so beautiful.</p>
        <p><b>In the next 40 years both of these lakes will start to disappear because of Climate Change which is causing glacial retreat and changes in water levels faster than before. For this reason I recommend that if you haven't seen these lakes that you try to make that trip.</b></p>
        <p>We had lunch at Trailhead Cafe — it wasn’t the best, but it filled us up. Dinner was at Masala, an Indian
            restaurant.</p>

        <h4>June 29</h4>
        <p>On this day, we finally got to try a bunch of restaurants and visit a few spots we missed earlier.</p>
        <p>I had seen a Japanese-Asian fusion restaurant the day before, so brunch was at Hello Sunshine. We got
            vegetarian ramen, avocado rolls, and the green rice bowl. The chili oil was a must in the ramen, and the
            avocado rolls were super filling — probably the most filling rolls I’ve ever had! I wouldn’t recommend the
            green rice bowl though. The restaurant itself had a really cozy and comforting vibe.</p>
        <p>For dessert, we went to Beavertails and got the Strawberry Cheesecake and Maple Beavertail with butterscotch
            ice cream. Both were yummy, though next time I’d probably just stick with the classic Beavertail.</p>
        <p>Finally, we revisited Bow Falls since it rained the last time. The falls are made up of several smaller
            waterfalls, and the main hike to the viewpoint is less than 20 minutes (there’s even a shorter 10-minute
            option). The falls make for great photos, but honestly, it was kind of tricky to tell some of the smaller
            falls apart from the currents!</p>

        <h3>Jasper</h3>
        <h4>June 30</h4>
        <p>This was the most exciting day ever! We got to walk on an actual glacier!</p>
