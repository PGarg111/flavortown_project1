        <p>This is a trip that I feel everyone should make in the next 20 years.</p>
        <p>...That was ominous.</p>
        <p>I'll explain everything about why, but first, I am going to recount my trip to Banff, Jasper and Vancouver in Canada!</p>

        <h3>Banff</h3>
        <p>Banff is a beautiful town located in the heart of the Canadian Rockies. It's known for its stunning mountain scenery, outdoor activities, and vibrant culture. The main attractions there are Banff National Park, Lake Louise, Moraine Lake (the picture above is one that I took of Moraine Lake), and the Banff Gondola. The main reason people visit Banff is for the glacial lakes, Lake Louise, Moraine Lake, Peyto Lake, Bow Lake, etc.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h4>June 26</h4>
        <p>When we visited Banff, we stayed at Hidden Ridge Resort. This resort had had the best views of the Canadian Rockies from multiple areas.</p>
        <p>We visited Bow Lake but weren't able to visit Bow falls because it started to rain. From Bow Lake the Banff Springs Hotel is visible.</p>
        <p>That evening we went to downtown Banff.</p>
        <p>
            That day we ate at Merhaba (Indian Restaurant) and Anejo (Mexican Restaurant).
        </p>
        <h4>June 27</h4>
        <p>This was the day of the Banff Gondola. The ride up the mountain in the gondola was a nice experience since everywhere around you were the views of the ranges and lakes. The only bad part was that day it was cloudy and a bit rainy.</p>
        <p>Despite that, we all enjoyed. When you reach the top there is a coffee and souvenir shop. I recommend getting the London Fog, which is a specialty drink in Canada.</p>
        <p>Later in the day we explored another lake: Two Jack Lake. This lake had really clear and blue water which was a sight you don't see in the United States often.</p>
        <p>For lunch we went to UNA which was an Italian restaurant. The pizza was really good there and I would recommend it.</p>
        <p>One place that I would definitely eat at again would be Earl's. The energy and vibe there was really lively and the food was also from different cuisines. </p>
