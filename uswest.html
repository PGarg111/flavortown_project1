    <div class="blog-content">
        <p>This was my first time in Vegas. </p>
        <p>Also, fun fact, I was born in Phoenix but I had no idea what the city was like until this trip (I didn't stay
            there long)!</p>

        <h3>Las Vegas</h3>
        <p>Las Vegas is a city known for its vibrant nightlife, entertainment options, and 24-hour casinos. It's a place
            where you can experience a mix of luxury and excitement.</p>
        <h4>December 22</h4>
        <p>We arrived in Las Vegas around 7 PM.</p>
        <p>After checking into the hotel and dropping off our stuff, we went out to explore the Strip. We had dinner at
            a Mexican restaurant to start off the trip.</p>
        <p>Since my dad had been to Vegas before (for a business trip and before we were born), he acted as our tour
            guide for the night. The only hotel we visited that day was the Venetian. I was honestly shocked by the
            indoor river and how they designed the inside to look like the streets of Venice.</p>

        <h4>December 23</h4>
        <p>We spent the entire day on the Strip.</p>
        <p>Our first stop was Caesars Palace, where we spent about 1–2 hours walking around the Forum Shops.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite parts was the art pieces and fountains built in Greek and Roman styles.</p>
        <p>The fountain show there was also really fun to watch!</p>
        <p>After Caesars Palace, we walked to the Bellagio to see their Christmas setup. There were so many people just
            taking pictures! I had hot chocolate while enjoying the festive atmosphere.</p>

        <h4>December 24</h4>
        <p>We spent our day on the Strip again.</p>
        <p>My sister really wanted gelato, so we went to Fontainebleau. Since this hotel is pretty new, there wasn’t as
            much to see yet.</p>
        <p>That night, we went to the baseball park for a Christmas festival. There were so many lights and cool
            activities. I took so many videos—I couldn’t help myself!</p>

        <h4>December 25</h4>
        <p>My mom wasn’t feeling well, so my sister, dad, and I explored some hotels on our own.</p>
        <p>The first hotel we visited was New York–New York. It was uncanny how they recreated the streets of New York
            City inside the hotel.</p>
        <p>Later, we went to Planet Hollywood, where my dad bought a sweater from US Polo Assn. because they had a big
            sale.</p>
        <p>That night, we visited Aria with my mom.</p>

        <h4><b>Some hotels we visited that I don’t remember the exact day for: Wynn, Cosmopolitan, MGM Grand, Encore,
                Paris</b></h4>

        <h3>Hoover Dam</h3>
        <h4>December 25</h4>
        <p>We drove to Hoover Dam, which marked the end of our time in Las Vegas. The dam was massive and super
            impressive—definitely an engineering marvel.</p>
        <p>We took a guided tour and learned about its history and how it was built. The views of the dam and the
            surrounding area were breathtaking.</p>
        <p>After that, we drove to Zion National Park. The hotel was amazing, especially because of its location and
            amenities. That night, we ate dinner at Thai Sapa. The food was good, but the service felt a little rude,
            probably because it was really busy.</p>

        <h3>Zion National Park</h3>
        <h4>December 26</h4>
        <p>Early in the morning, we hiked to a sunrise viewpoint (we were a bit late though) called the Canyon Overlook
            Trail. We were surrounded by mountains in every direction!!!</p>
        <p>We had brunch at the hotel restaurant afterward, and the food was really good.</p>
        <p>Later, we went on another short hike to a river, though I can’t remember the name of the trail or the river.
        </p>
        <p>We grabbed lunch on the way back and spent the rest of the night relaxing at the hotel.</p>

        <h3>Grand Canyon + Flagstaff</h3>
        <h4>December 28</h4>
        <p>This was our only full day in Zion National Park, and it was truly unforgettable. After that, we headed
            toward the Grand Canyon.</p>
        <p>At the Grand Canyon, I took so many pictures and videos of the rocks. Every view looked different and showed
            a new side of the landscape.</p>
        <p>Our hotel was in Flagstaff, so after spending about two hours at the Grand Canyon, we drove there and
            explored the downtown area.</p>

        <h3>Sedona</h3>
        <h4>December 29</h4>
        <p>Around noon, we drove to the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff. It was really interesting learning about
            astronomy, and I even got to see the sun through a telescope!!</p>
        <p>Fun fact: the planet Pluto was discovered at the Lowell Observatory.</p>
        <p>We spent a good amount of time there before driving to Sedona.</p>
        <p>In Sedona, we walked around downtown and had dinner there.</p>

        <h3>Antelope Canyon + Phoenix</h3>
        <h4>December 30</h4>
        <p>We only spent one night in Sedona before driving to Horseshoe Bend, arriving around 1 PM. The rock formation
            was fascinating, but I wouldn’t recommend going out of your way to see it.</p>
        <p>We didn’t stay long because we had a tour scheduled at Antelope Canyon.</p>
        <p>Antelope Canyon was absolutely stunning! The way the light came through the narrow openings made everything
            look unreal. I took countless photos trying to capture the swirling sandstone formations. With certain
            filters, the canyon looks even more amazing (the picture at the top of this blog is one I took).</p>
        <p>After the tour, we drove to Phoenix, where we spent time with family friends before flying back home.</p>

        <h3>End of Trip</h3>
        <p>This was truly another unforgettable trip! I got to explore so many natural sights and see some incredible
            cities!</p>
        <p>Below are some of the pictures that I took during the trip:</p>
