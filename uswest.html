    <div class="blog-content">
        <p>This was my first time in Vegas. </p>
        <p>Also, fun fact, I was born in Phoenix but I had no idea what the city was like until this trip (I didn't stay there long)!</p>

        <h3>Las Vegas</h3>
        <p>Las Vegas is a city known for its vibrant nightlife, entertainment options, and 24-hour casinos. It's a place where you can experience a mix of luxury and excitement.</p>
        <h4>December 22</h4>
        <p>We arrived in Las Vegas around 7 PM at night. </p>
        <p>After going to the hotel and dropping off our stuff, we headed out to explore the Strip. First we had dinner at a mexican restaurant.</p>
        <p>Since my dad had been to Vegas before for a business trip and before we were born, he was our tour guide for the night. The only hotel we visited that day was the Venetian. I was a little shocked seeing the river that runs through the hotel and the way they built the inside to mimic a street in Venice.</p>

        <h4>December 23</h4>
        <p>We spent the entire day on the strip.</p>
        <p>The first destination was Caesars Palace. I feel like we spent about an 1-2 hours in the Forum Shops.</p>
        <p>One of the things I liked the best were the art pieces and fountains that were build in styles like the Greek and Roman. </p>
        <p>The fountain show was also fun to watch!</p>

        <p>After Caesars Palace, we walked to the Bellagio and saw the Christmas setup they had. There were so many people there just to take pictures!! I had hot chocolate while enjoying the festive atmosphere.</p>

        <h4>December 24</h4>
        <p>We spend our day on the strip [again].</p>
        <p>My sister wanted gelato so we went to Fontainebleau. This hotel is relatively new so there wasn't as much there.</p>

        <p>At night that day we went the baseball park to see the Christmas festival. There were so many lights and cool activities. I took so many videos! I couldn't help myself.</p>
        <h4>December 25</h4>
        <p>My mother wasn't feeling well today, so me, my sister, and our dad went and explored some hotels by ourselves.</p>
        <p>The first one we went to was New York New York. It was uncanny how there were able to replicate the streets of New York City inside the hotel.</p>
        <p>Later we went to Planet Hollywood where my dad bought a sweater at US Polo Assn. from their big sale. </p>
        <p>We visited Aria that night with my mother.</p>
        <h4><b>Some hotels we visited that I don't recall which day we visited: Wynn, Cosmopolitan, MGM Grand, Encore, Paris</b></h4>
        
        <h3>Hoover Dam</h3>
        <h4>December 25</h4>
        <p>Today we drove to Hoover Dam, ending our stay in Las Vegas. Hoover Dam was impressive and massive, a true engineering marvel. We took a guided tour and learned about its history and construction. The views of the dam and the surrounding area were breathtaking.</p>
        <p>We headed out from there and drove to Zion National Park. The hotel was amazing, mostly due to the location and amenities. That night we had dinner at Thai Sapa, which was good, but the service was a bit rude, I think because of the rush.</p>
        
        <h3>Zion National Park</h3>
        <h4>December 26</h4>
        <p>Early in the morning we hiked to a sunrise viewpoint (a bit late though) called Canyon Overlook Trail. We were completely surrounded by mountains everywhere!!!</p>
        <p>At the hotel we had brunch at their restaurant, and the food was delicious!</p>
        <p>Later, we took another small hike to a river (I can't remember the name of the river or hike). </p>
        <p>We had lunch on the way back and spent the rest of the night at the hotel.</p>

        <h3>Grand Canyon + Flagstaff</h3>
        <h4>December 28</h4>
        <p>That was our only day in Zion National Park, and it was truly unforgettable. Now we started towards the Grand Canyon.</p>
        <p>At the Grand Canyon I took so many pictures and videos the rock. Every image was different from the last, capturing the unique beauty of the landscape.</p>
        <p>Our hotel was in Flagstaff, so we drove there and explored their downtown area after spending about 2 hours at the Grand Canyon.</p>

        <h3>Sedona</h3>
        <h4>December 29</h4>
        <p>Around noon, we drove to Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff. The observatory offered fascinating insights into astronomy, and we enjoyed learning about the stars and planets. I got to see the sun through a telescope!! </p>
        <p>Fun fact: it was here in the Lowell Observatory where the planet Pluto was discovered.</p>
        <p>We spend a good amount of time in the observatory and then headed for Sedona.</p>
        <p>In Sedona, we talked around downtown for some time and had dinner there. </p>

        <h3>Antelope Canyon + Phoenix</h3>
        <h4>December 30</h4>
        <p>We only spend the night in Sedona. We drove to the Horseshoe Bend, reaching around 1pm. I though the formation of the rock was fascinating, but I wouldn't recommend that you take time out of your itinerary to see it.</p>
        <p>We didn't stay there long because of our tour of Antelope Canyon.</p>
        <p>Antelope Canyon was absolutely stunning! The way the light filtered through the narrow openings created a surreal atmosphere. I took countless photos, trying to capture the beauty of the swirling sandstone formations. With certain filters, the beauty of the canyon can be captured (as seen in the picture at the top of this blog, I took that photo and countless others)</p>
        <p>After the tour, we drove to Phoenix. There we spent time with family friends before flying back home.</p>
        <h3>End of Trip</h3>
        <p>This was truly another unforgettable trip! I got to explore so many natural sights and see some incredible cities!</p>
        <p>Below are some of the pictures that I took during the trip:</p>
